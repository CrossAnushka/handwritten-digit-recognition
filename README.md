# Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM & KNN

This project uses the scikit-learn digits dataset to classify handwritten digits using two machine learning algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.



## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Preprocessed and scaled pixel features from image data.
- Trained and evaluated two ML models:
  - âœ… SVM with RBF kernel
  - âœ… KNN Classifier
- Compared model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.



## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook



## ðŸ“Š Results

- SVM with RBF kernel achieved **higher accuracy** and more stable predictions than KNN.
- Visualized confusion matrix and digit predictions for analysis.
